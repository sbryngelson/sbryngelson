## Hi👋🏼, I'm Spencer!👨🏻‍💻

* I am an Assistant Professor in the [CSE School](https://cse.gatech.edu) 🏫 of the [Georgia Tech College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/)
  * I have courtesy appointments in the [Guggenheim AE School](https://ae.gatech.edu) and the [Woodruff ME School](https://me.gatech.edu)
* I have a [research group](https://comp-physics.group) here and [awesome students](https://comp-physics.group/team)
* We solve problems in ❤️ health and ✈️ defense with **computational methods**, **fast algorithms**, and **big computers**
* 🖥️ We develop and maintain several open-source libraries and solvers [(more on that here!)](https://github.com/comp-physics)
* 👥 If you want to work with us, [check out this page!](https://comp-physics.group/vacancies.html) 

In particular, I encourage you to check out [MFC](mflowcode.github.io) ([GitHub repo.](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC)) if you are interested in multiphase or compressible CFD ✈️, it is an exascale solver our group develops and maintains!
